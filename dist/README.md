  # ReadMe Generator

  ## DESCRIPTION
   >  Writing clear descriptions of my programs can be daunting. 
   >  With this program, I can focus more on the coding and less on the describing. 
   >  By answering question prompts I am able to focus on small bites of the README and less on a whole picture. 
   >  This project helped me gain a stronger understanding of node.js and JavaScript.
